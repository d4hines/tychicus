# Tychicus

Have you ever needed a ready and able messenger to forward emails between two accounts? Tychicus is your man! 

Currently is hard-coded against certain GMail protocols, but uses IMAP and SMTP via Java Mail, so could easily be extended to support other providers.

## Installation

Build from the source or use the docker file: 


## Usage

```
    $ java -jar tychicus-0.1.0-standalone.jar
```
